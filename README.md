Git Tips:

The best feature of Git is StackExchange. When I don't know how to do something in Git, I type some words that seem relevant into Google. The top hit is usually a Stackoverflow discussion where someone asked the same question I have and got at least one answer that tells me what I need to know.

To use my GitHub username, within the repo:
    git config user.name bryangeneolson
